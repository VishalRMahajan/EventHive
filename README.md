## Problem Statement

College events often face challenges with ticket booking and verification processes, leading to long queues, manual errors, and confusion. Organizers struggle to efficiently manage ticket sales and verify attendees, resulting in a poor user experience. Attendees, on the other hand, face inconvenience and delays during event entry. These issues highlight the need for a streamlined ticketing and verification system to enhance the overall event experience for both organizers and attendees.
## How It Works

1. **Registration**: Users register for an account using their @student.sfit.ac.in email.
2. **Login**: Students log in with their @student.sfit.ac.in email, and committee members log in with @sfit.ac.in email.
3. **Dashboard**: Both students and committee members access a common dashboard.
4. **Event Details**: Students can view event details on the dashboard, including event information and ticket availability.
5. **Ticket Purchase**: Students can buy tickets by clicking on the "Buy Ticket" button, which redirects them to the Razorpay payment gateway for online payment.
6. **Payment Confirmation**: After successful payment, a QR code is sent to the student's email for ticket authentication.
7. **QR Code Scan and Ticket Verification**: At the event, the QR code on the ticket is scanned for authentication and verification.
8. **Ticket Management**: Students can view their tickets by clicking on the "Tickets" button on the dashboard.
9. **Committee Functions**: Committee members can add events and view the list of students who have booked tickets.
